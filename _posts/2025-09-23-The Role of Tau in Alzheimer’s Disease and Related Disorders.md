**Why This Article**

Since participating as a PACE student at the Dementia Research Centre, I have developed a strong interest in neurodegenerative diseases. The project I worked on involved creating a clone with an isoform of the mouse tau protein, through which I came to understand that tau protein plays a critical role and is a major contributor to Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, studying tau protein is essential for understanding the disease mechanism and exploring potential avenues for drug discovery.

**Background**

* Alzheimer’s disease is one of the neurodegenerative disorders, and patients with this condition exhibit numerous pathological changes, such as synaptic and neuronal loss, amyloid plaques, and hyperphosphorylated tau protein.
* Although extensive research and clinical trials targeting amyloid have been conducted, these approaches have often been insufficient, as amyloid accumulation involves multiple pathways and causes diverse types of damage.
* Consequently, tau protein, based on the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease, has gained increasing attention as a therapeutic target. This article focuses on the critical role of tau protein in therapy and discusses areas that require further development and improvement.

**Main Finding**

*Molecular Biology of Protein Tau* 

* There are six isoforms of tau proteins in the adult human brain; 3R0N,3R1N, 3R2N, 4R0N, 4R1N, and 4R2N.
* The role of tau protein is not only to stabilize tubulin and microtubules, but also to protect neurons from acute apoptotic death by stabilizing β-catenin through its phosphorylation.
* Disruption in the equilibrium of tau kinases and tau phosphatases activity → Hyperphosphorylation of tau protein → Decreased affinity for microtubules → Increased degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway → Fibrillization and aggregation into NFTs
* Major tau kinases: GSK GSK-3ß, CDK5, PKA, MAPK, CaMK II, and MARK.

<br>
*Experimental Models of Tau*

* Specific kinease and phosphate has been focused on reaserch as most commonly tau mutation inhibits microtuble assembly by promoting hyperphosphorylation of tau. 
* Triple transgenic model (3xTg-AD) is useing for explaination the relationship among Aß, tau, and synaptic dysfunction 
* The relationship between Aß and tau pathology is clear, as Aß removed by Aß-specific antibodies reduced the tau burden in the 3xTg-AD mouse model.
* Blocking tau phosphorylation in the tau P301L mouse model reduced soluble tau aggregates and protected against motor dysfunction, while leaving NFTs unaffected.
* Soluble tau phosphorylation impairs microtubule assembly via MAP sequestration and contributes to degeneration of dendrites and axons.

*Tau As a Therapeutic Target*

* The principal strategies targeting tau in neurodegenerative diseases

1) Inhibition abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation by kinases

2) Promotion of tau aggregate disassembly using compounds

3) Enhancement of microtubule stabilization with compounds

4) Activation of intracellular clearance pathways

5) Tau immunotherapy

6) Anti-inflammatory therapy
  
* Memantine (Namenda) has been shown to decrease abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau and to exert beneficial effects in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.
* In 2020, two drugs—Methylene blue (Rember) and the neuronal tubulin-preferring agent AL-108—were evaluated in clinical trials.

<br>
**Limitations & Future Perspectives**

* Inhibition of kinases and phosphatases affects numerous targets; therefore, convincing preclinical data, including studies in higher-order species, will be required to ensure minimal adverse effects in human trials.
* The data which accumulation of extracellular tau affect inside of cell has been demonstrated via *in-vitro* studies; therefore *in vivo* studies will be required. 
* Identifying the conditions that induce robust tau pathology in human wild-type tau transgenic models will be an important direction for future research.

<br>
**Conclusion**

* The development of drugs for AD can still be considered optimistic, despite many setbacks, as there are potential candidates targeting tau pathology.
* Moving towards combination therapies may lead to more effective treatment strategies by simultaneously targeting multiple aspects of AD, such as Aß accumulation and subsequent oxidative and inflammatory damage.

**Personal Insight**

As someone who is interested in neurodegenerative disorders, this article is appropriate for understanding general knowledge about tau protein and its link with other molecules. In addition, it provides insight into the ongoing approaches to drug development for AD.

This article was published in 2020, and I think many of the approaches mentioned may have developed since then. The topics that I found particularly interesting were different isoforms, tau kinases, and transgenic mouse models, and I would like to research these further.
