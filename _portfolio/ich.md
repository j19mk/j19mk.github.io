The ICH guidelines are fundamental and essential for conducting clinical trials. They are divided into four categories: Quality, Safety, Efficacy, and Multidisciplinary. The Efficacy guidelines relate to clinical trials, addressing the design, conduct, safety, and reporting of clinical studies.

In this section, the Efficacy guidelines will be summarized. Documents such as study protocols and SAPs from ClinicalTrials.gov will be analyzed and compared to the guidelines.
