I believe these concepts are critical for clinical trials, not only to understand the mechanisms of diseases but also to comprehend how drugs act within the body. This knowledge is essential for efficiently and accurately interpreting clinical trial results and data. Moreover, it is beneficial for designing and optimizing the phases of clinical trials.

In this section, I will explore the mechanisms of diseases and drug actions that interest me by reviewing papers and articles. The focus will primarily be on oncology and neurodegenerative diseases, along with their related drug actions.
