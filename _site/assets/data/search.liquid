LaFerlaWhy This ArticleSince participating as a PACE student at the Dementia Research Centre, I have developed a strong interest in neurodegenerative diseases. The project I worked on involved creating a clone with an isoform of the mouse tau protein, through which I came to understand that tau protein plays a critical role and is a major contributor to Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, studying tau protein is essential for understanding the disease mechanism and exploring potential avenues for drug discovery.Background Alzheimer’s disease is one of the neurodegenerative disorders, and patients with this condition exhibit numerous pathological changes, such as synaptic and neuronal loss, amyloid plaques, and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Although extensive research and clinical trials targeting amyloid have been conducted, these approaches have often been insufficient, as amyloid accumulation involves multiple pathways and causes diverse types of damage. Consequently, tau protein, based on the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease, has gained increasing attention as a therapeutic target. This article focuses on the critical role of tau protein in therapy and discusses areas that require further development and improvement.Main FindingMolecular Biology of Protein Tau There are six isoforms of tau proteins in the adult human brain; 3R0N,3R1N, 3R2N, 4R0N, 4R1N, and 4R2N. The role of tau protein is not only to stabilize tubulin and microtubules, but also to protect neurons from acute apoptotic death by stabilizing β-catenin through its phosphorylation. Disruption in the equilibrium of tau kinases and tau phosphatases activity → Hyperphosphorylation of tau protein → Decreased affinity for microtubules → Increased degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway → Fibrillization and aggregation into NFTs Major tau kinases: GSK GSK-3ß, CDK5, PKA, MAPK, CaMK II, and MARK.Experimental Models of Tau Specific kinease and phosphate has been focused on reaserch as most commonly tau mutation inhibits microtuble assembly by promoting hyperphosphorylation of tau. Triple transgenic model (3xTg-AD) is useing for explaination the relationship among Aß, tau, and synaptic dysfunction The relationship between Aß and tau pathology is clear, as Aß removed by Aß-specific antibodies reduced the tau burden in the 3xTg-AD mouse model. Blocking tau phosphorylation in the tau P301L mouse model reduced soluble tau aggregates and protected against motor dysfunction, while leaving NFTs unaffected. Soluble tau phosphorylation impairs microtubule assembly via MAP sequestration and contributes to degeneration of dendrites and axons.Tau As a Therapeutic Target The principal strategies targeting tau in neurodegenerative diseases1) Inhibition abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation by kinases2) Promotion of tau aggregate disassembly using compounds3) Enhancement of microtubule stabilization with compounds4) Activation of intracellular clearance pathways5) Tau immunotherapy6) Anti-inflammatory therapy Memantine (Namenda) has been shown to decrease abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau and to exert beneficial effects in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. In 2020, two drugs—Methylene blue (Rember) and the neuronal tubulin-preferring agent AL-108—were evaluated in clinical trials.Limitations &amp;amp; Future Perspectives Inhibition of kinases and phosphatases affects numerous targets; therefore, convincing preclinical data, including studies in higher-order species, will be required to ensure minimal adverse effects in human trials. The data which accumulation of extracellular tau affect inside of cell has been demonstrated via in-vitro studies; therefore in vivo studies will be required. Identifying the conditions that induce robust tau pathology in human wild-type tau transgenic models will be an important direction for future research.Conclusion The development of drugs for AD can still be considered optimistic, despite many setbacks, as there are potential candidates targeting tau pathology. Moving towards combination therapies may lead to more effective treatment strategies by simultaneously targeting multiple aspects of AD, such as Aß accumulation and subsequent oxidative and inflammatory damage.Personal InsightAs someone who is interested in neurodegenerative disorders, this article is appropriate for understanding general knowledge about tau protein and its link with other molecules. In addition, it provides insight into the ongoing approaches to drug development for AD.This article was published in 2020, and I think many of the approaches mentioned may have developed since then. The topics that I found particularly interesting were different isoforms, tau kinases, and transgenic mouse models, and I would like to research these further.Reference The Role of Tau in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders" }, { "title" : "&lt;span style=&#39;color:black;&#39;&gt;Top 10 Target Pathways for Cancer drugs&lt;/span&gt;", "category" : "", "tags" : " R", "url" : "/2025/09/03/Top10-Target-Pathways-for-Cancer-drugs.html", "date" : "September 3, 2025", "excerpt" : "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020.

H1: There is significant difference in examination results between the summer and winter semesters. 4) Results &amp;amp; Interpretation Normality shaprio.test: As both p-values are greater than 0.05, H0 which states that the data come from a normal distribution, is not rejected. Homogeneity of variance Boxplot: The data distribution for winter is slightly more spread out compared to that for summer, and both distributions are slightly right-skewed. Levene Test: The p-value is 0.2494, which is greater than 0.05, indicating that the two groups have homogeneity of variance. t-value: The t-value is 1.0352, which is smaller than the critical t-value (2.073873), indicating that H0 is unlikely to be rejected. p-value: The p-value (0.3118) is much greater than 0.05, leading to the conclusion that H0 is not rejected. 5) Conclusion To determine the difference examination results between the summer and winter semester, the independent samples t-test was conducted.
